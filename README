# US Frequent Poverty Measure
This repository contains code for a monthly US Frequent Poverty Measure based on the CPS (Current Population Survey). It contains scripts to download the most recent data and create figures showing the frequent poverty rate. 

It is the product of some work by contributors at the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality including Koji Chavez, Charles Varner, Marybeth Mattingly, and Giovanni Righi.
